<chapter title="Chapter 1" start="0" duration="3"/>

This is another paragraph without an explicit actor tag,
so it will use the default actor (narrator).


<bulletlist start="5" bullet_delay="2">
    <item>First point</item>
    <item>Second point</item>
    <item>Third point</item>
</bulletlist>

<actor name="actor1"/>
This is the first paragraph spoken by actor1.

This is another paragraph without an explicit actor tag,
Because actor1 is the current actor specified at the previous paragraph, actor1 will also be the actor of this paragraph.
